Solid State Logic Duende Native v5.1.1 WIN VST PORTABLE is a collection of audio processing plugins that emulate the sound and features of SSL's legendary console products. The plugins include EQ & Dynamics Channel, Stereo Bus Compressor, Drumstrip, Vocalstrip, X-Comp, X-EQ and X-Verb. The plugins are compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit DAWs that support VST format on Windows operating systems.
 
The plugins offer superior audio quality, precision and performance, as well as the distinctive tonal characteristics of SSL's hardware. The EQ & Dynamics Channel is a versatile channel strip plugin that features a four-band parametric EQ, a gate/expander, a compressor/limiter and a filter section. The Stereo Bus Compressor is a faithful emulation of the center section compressor from SSL's G Series analogue console, which is widely regarded as a classic for mastering and mixing. The Drumstrip and Vocalstrip are specialized plugins that provide a range of tools for processing drums and vocals respectively, such as transient shaper, de-esser, enhancer and reverb. The X-Comp is a flexible and transparent compressor that can handle anything from subtle dynamic control to extreme compression effects. The X-EQ is a powerful and flexible equalizer that features 10 bands of parametric EQ with various filter types and curves. The X-Verb is a high-quality reverb plugin that offers a range of algorithms and parameters to create realistic and creative spaces.

The plugins are easy to use and have a sleek and intuitive interface that resembles SSL's hardware. The plugins also have a low CPU usage and can run smoothly on most systems. The plugins require an iLok 2 or 3 Smart Key for authorization, which may be a drawback for some users who prefer machine location activation. However, SSL offers a free crossgrade to SSL Native V6 for existing Duende Native V5 owners, which allows machine location activation and also features higher resolution GUI and improved framework. The SSL Native V6 plugins are compatible with the Duende Native V5 presets and licenses, but not vice versa.
 
Overall, Solid State Logic Duende Native v5.1.1 WIN VST PORTABLE is an impressive collection of plugins that deliver the sound and quality of SSL's console products in a convenient and affordable package. The plugins are suitable for any genre and style of music production, and can enhance any mix with their professional and musical processing. The plugins are available for download from SSL's website[^1^] or from various online stores[^2^] [^3^].
